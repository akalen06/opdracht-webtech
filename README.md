# My Github Repo

This is the repository I've created for my assignment.

## Scripts

- `hello.sh`: Print "Hello, world!".
- `calc.sh`: Solves any math equation given to it.

## Problems & solutions

- When I did my first git push my terminal asked me to sign up with my username and password, however when I entered my credentials I would constantly get a fatal error saying that Github does not support password authentication

- I had to generate an SSH key to solve this problem, which caused no problem at all
